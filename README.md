autocrunch-ami
==============

A quick-look reduction script for automated imaging of AMI-LA data, 
using the real-time processing tricks demonstrated in [autocrunch](https://github.com/timstaley/autocrunch).

Good for identifying promising targets quickly, but flux values should not be used in a final analysis.

For background info, see [the paper](https://github.com/timstaley/automated-radio-imaging-paper).
